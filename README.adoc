Welcome to QAvalidator.

== About

QAvalidator is a tool to model your architecture and check the dependencies in your code.

== Build

* The build process is a Gradle build.
* For the UI, it uses NodeJS and Webpack via Gradle.
* For the Maven Plugin, use Maven. It's not built within the Gradle build.

Do a

  gradlew [clean] build

on top level to build everything (except the Maven plugin).

Sometimes, the Node stuff has problems with the console. To avoid those, the workaround is:

  gradlew --console plain [... tasks ...]


== Release

Preparation::
* Finish the release notes
* Make sure the example files and i-tests are up-to-date.

Perform the release::
To create the release and to upload at into the company's Nexus, use this command:

  gradlew --console plain clean build release -PnexusUsername=USERNAME -PnexusPassword=PASSWORD

Maven Plugin::
To release the Maven plugin, edit the `pom.xml` and set the new version number.
Use the standard release plugin:

  cd qav-maven-plugin
  mvn release:prepare
  mvn release:perform

Publish to bintray::
To publish that version to bintray, edit the file `gradle.properties`, set the `version` property back to the just
released version, and rebuild and upload everything.
Don't commit that file, just revert it afterwards.
Use this command:

  gradlew --console plain clean build bintrayUpload -PbintrayUsername=BINTRAY_USER -PbintrayApiKey=BINRAY_API_KEY

To publish the Maven plugin to Bintray, set the `version` property back to the just released version, and use this command;
don't commit that file, just revert it afterwards.

  cd qav-maven-plugin
  mvn deploy -P bintray

Update the Documentation::
To publish the latest documentation at https://qavalidator.github.io,
use the Gradle task `copyDocToWebsite` in `qav-doc`. To cleanup beforehand, use `cleanDocInWebsite`. This updates the AsciiDoc documentation in the project's site project `qavalidator/qavalidator.github.io`. Commit and push that project separately.
